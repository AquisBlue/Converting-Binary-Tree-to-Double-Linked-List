# Converting-Binary-Tree-to-Double-Linked-List
Binary Tree to Double Linked List using Collections in Java

Java Collections provides us with the LinkedList data structure which is actually a doubly linked list. We can create the Binary Tree on our own and use Collections for creating the doubly linked list.

To convert BT to DLL, we basically have to store the nodes from the tree into the DLL in inorder fashion.
